     <h3>Overview of Artificial Consciousness Workshop</h3>
      <p>Artificial Consciousness is a field related to AI, Cognitive Robotics and Philosophy of Mind. Although still quite limited, artificial intelligence has made impressive gains across a wide array of domains, including image, voice, and natural language processing as well as goal-based action planning for autonomous control.
Machine learning, and in particular the combination of deep neural networks and reinforcement learning algorithms, have enabled breakthroughs in perception-action systems in the fields of computer vision, low-level natural language processing, and game playing.
However, these types of tasks all correspond to the sort of processing that people can accomplish with little conscious effort. In contrast, the sort of processing which humans can do only when they apply their conscious mind to it  remains a challenge for current deep learning. Examples include semantic understanding, counterfactual reasoning, and long-term planning. It is hypothesized, and supported by evidence, that the functionalities associated with consciousness help humans generalize better out-of-distribution, enable them to re-use knowledge in appropriate and novel ways, capture causal dependencies, reason and plan at an abstract level, and manipulate deliberately the kind of high-level concepts which we communicate with natural language. 
This workshop will explore the functions associated with consciousness and how they could be implemented by machine learning algorithms, what their advantages would be for learning agents, and what this could mean at a philosophical and social level if we could do it. An interesting hypothesis is that the kind of high-level knowledge which can be manipulated consciously satisfies assumptions which provide generalization advantages, in particular in a changing environment.
This workshop is therefore by nature highly multi-disciplinary, with progress in this field requiring the meeting of minds from disciplines like machine learning, neuroscience, cognitive science and philosophy of mind.
</p>
      <p>ArtCons 2020 Goals:</p>
      <ul>
<li>Bring together researchers interested in the possibility of building systems benefitting from the functionalities associated with consciousness in order to frame the problem of machine consciousness in a way that is tractable and bypasses the taboos about consciousness.</li>
<li>Start a conversation on machine consciousness that is informed by emerging models of consciousness in neuroscience and well as recent philosophical thought on the nature of mind.</li>
<li>Examine adjacent fields such as embodied cognition, autonomous agents, online learning, scene understanding, and conversational AI while considering how an agent might dynamically construct a world model that contains self-aware agents.</li>
<li>Define the theoretical and technical problems to be solved: what abilities would an AI system need to implement the functions associated with consciousness?  How can that be translated into architectures and training frameworks for new types of deep learning systems?</li>
</ul>
